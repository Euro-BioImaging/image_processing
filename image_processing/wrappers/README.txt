Here I will dump some tools that combine existing packages such as trimesh, pyvista, ITK, igl and etc.

The combination of these tools in an intuitive way facilitates certain image/mesh processing tasks.

Due to the high number of dependencies, I do not yet include this package in the default pip installation.
A separate installation recipe will be created later.
