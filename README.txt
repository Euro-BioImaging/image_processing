A toolbox for the processing of 3D microscopy images.
Included are tools for feature enhancement, segmentation,
geometrical transformations and etc.  


Use the following command for installing the package:

pip install git+https://github.com/bugraoezdemir/image_processing


Note that the pip installation deliberately excludes the 'wrappers' sub-package
because of the high number of dependencies. The 'wrappers' package will be
included in a separate installation recipe later.
